For my final project, I will be conducting a Twitter content analysis in conjunction with my MA thesis. My thesis is on the #NotBuyingIt Twitter campaign, in which users post pictures of sexist or misogynistic products and call for a boycott of the retailer. The campaign has been remarkably successful at getting retailers to apologize and pull the targeted product. For my thesis, I am conducting a larger content analysis of Twitter data in order to determine the constitutive elements of successful #NotBuyingIt efforts. For this project, I want to undertake a content analysis of three targeted #NotBuyingIt efforts, one in which the targeted company apologized and pulled the product (Veet), one in which the company took no action (Code Babes), and one in which the company initially apologized and pulled the product but then reinstated the product at a later time (LaPerla). I hope to use this smaller case study as a pilot test for my larger thesis project and to further develop my facility with the Twitter REST API and content analysis skills that will serve me well in the future!
